      Every athelete who participates in CIS training or competition is subject to doping control. Each CIS athlete is required to sign the "CIS Athlete Acknowledgement and Consent Form (AAC)" indicating their understanding of, and adherence to, CIS Anti-Doping Policy, and which includes their consent to doping control for a period of 18 months as of the date of signing. Failure to complete and sign the AAC form may result in an athlete's ineligibility for participation in any CIS program(s) but will not preclude doping control if the athlete has participated in any CIS training or competition. Sanctions for anti-doping rule violations are as specified in the CADP (available at <a href="http://www.cces.ca">www.cces.ca</a>), except as modified by CIS Policy (available at <a href="http://www.cis-sic.ca">www.cis-sic.ca</a>).
